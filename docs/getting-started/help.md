# Getting Help

Having trouble? We'd like to help!

* Read this developer guide. This guide is the most comprehensive documentation available and we're continually working to improve upon it.
* Look for a `README.md` file in the root directory of a component for component-specific information. Keeping the documentation close to the code it describes makes it more likely to stay up to date.
* Search for information in the archives of the [openlumify mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openlumify). If you don't find what you're looking for, post a new message.
* Visit the [OpenLumify blog](https://www.openlumify.com/blog/). We regularly post examples of using OpenLumify and announce new features.
* Search for a bug on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openlumify/openlumify/issues). Create a new one if you don't find an existing report of your problem.
* Read the [source code](source-code.md). Yes it's tedious and not for the faint of heart, but it's also undeniably authoritative.
